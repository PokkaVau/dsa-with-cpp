# DSA With C++

This repository contains my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** solutions implemented in **C++**.  
All problems are solved by me while learning from the [Apna College DSA playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfqMhTWNBTe137I_EPQd34TsgV6IO55pt&si=8VlpcVosFwcCUuEZ).

> ⚠️ Note: Currently, the repository does **not** follow a structured folder organization.  
> Each `.cpp` file includes comments at the top with the problem name, description, and any additional info.

- Each file is self-explanatory with **problem details commented**.
- Files are named as they were solved (e.g., `P1.cpp`, `P2.cpp`, …).
